# Security Policy

Thank you for your interest in helping us improve the security of our open source products, websites and other properties.

## How can I report a security bug?

We take plugin security extremely seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it in a safe and responsible manner.

You can report the issue through our [Bug Bounty Program](https://brainstormforce.com/bug-bounty-program/). We collaborate with Patchstack to provide opportunities for researchers to report vulnerabilities. The Patchstack team will help validate, triage, and handle any reported security issues.
