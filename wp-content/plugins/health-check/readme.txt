Health Check identifies common problems, and helps you troubleshoot plugin and theme conflicts.

== Description ==

This plugin will perform a number of checks on your WordPress installation to detect common configuration errors and known issues, and also allows plugins and themes to add their own checks.

The debug section, which allows you to gather information about your WordPress and server configuration that you may easily share with support representatives for themes, plugins or on the official WordPress.org support forums.

Troubleshooting allows you to have a clean WordPress session, where all plugins are disabled, and a default theme is used, but only for your user until you disable it or log out.

The Tools section allows you to check that WordPress files have not been tampered with, that emails can be sent, and if your plugins are compatible with any PHP version updates in the future.

For a more extensive example of how to efficiently use the Health Check plugin, check out the [WordPress.org support team handbook page about this plugin](https://make.wordpress.org/support/handbook/appendix/troubleshooting-using-the-health-check/).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I am unable to access my site after enabling troubleshooting =

If you should find your self stuck in Troubleshooting Mode for any reason, you can easily disable it by clearing your cookies.

Are you unfamiliar with how to clear your cookies? No worries, you may also close all your browser windows, or perform a computer restart and it will clear this specific cookie automatically.

= The PHP compatibility says this plugin only work with PHP version X? =

The plugin is made to be a support tool for as many users as possible, this means it needs code that is written for older sites as well.

Tools that check for PHP compatibility do not know how to separate this code from the real code, so it will give a false positive response.

At this time, the plugin has been tested with every version of PHP from 5.2 through 7.3, and works with all of these.
